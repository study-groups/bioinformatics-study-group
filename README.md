Information about genomic data science.

- [Genomics wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics) Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes. A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body

by Burak Himmetoglu.  We present an application of the boosted regression tree algorithm for predicting ground state energies of molecules made up of C, H, N, O, P, and S (CHNOPS). The PubChem chemical compound database has been incorporated to construct a dataset of 16,242 molecules, whose electronic ground state energies have been computed using density functional theory.

## Data Sets
- [Google genomics data sets](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/public-datasets/) Cloud Genomics provides a variety of public datasets that you can access for free and integrate into your applications. Google hosts these datasets, providing public access to the data.
