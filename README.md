by Dimitris Anastassiou. Genomic information is digital in a very real sense; it is
represented in the form of sequences of which each element
can be one out of a finite number of entities.

Abstract
This data explosion driven by advancements in genomic research, such as high-throughput
sequencing techniques, is constantly challenging conventional methods used in genomics.
In parallel with the urgent demand for robust algorithms, deep learning has succeeded
in a variety of fields such as vision, speech, and text processing. Yet genomics entails
unique challenges to deep learning since we are expecting from deep learning a superhuman
intelligence that explores beyond our knowledge to interpret the genome. A powerful deep
learning model should rely on insightful utilization of task-specific knowledge. In this
paper, we briefly discuss the strengths of different deep learning models from a genomic
perspective so as to fit each particular task with a proper deep architecture, and remark on
practical considerations of developing modern deep learning architectures for genomics. We
also provide a concise review of deep learning applications in various aspects of genomic
research, as well as pointing out current challenges and potential research directions for
future genomics applications.

## Subject definitions

- [Systems Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology): Systems biology is the computational and mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. It is a biology-based interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) to biological research.

- [Genomics wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics) Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes. A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body 

## Links
- [Tree based machine learning framework for predicting ground state energies of molecules ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07124) 
by Burak Himmetoglu.  We present an application of the boosted regression tree algorithm for predicting ground state energies of molecules made up of C, H, N, O, P, and S (CHNOPS). The PubChem chemical compound database has been incorporated to construct a dataset of 16,242 molecules, whose electronic ground state energies have been computed using density functional theory.

## Data Sets
- [Google genomics data sets](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/public-datasets/) Cloud Genomics provides a variety of public datasets that you can access for free and integrate into your applications. Google hosts these datasets, providing public access to the data.

## Software
[HCA](https://mloss.org/software/title/?page=11) Multi-core non-parametric and bursty topic models (HDP-LDA, DCMLDA, and other variants of LDA) implemented in C using efficient Gibbs sampling, with hyperparameter sampling and other flexible controls.

## Companies

[Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/) Tempus is a technology company that has built the worldâ€™s largest library of clinical and molecular data and an operating system to make that data accessible and useful, starting with cancer. Our goal is for each patient to benefit from the treatment of others who came before.
